It has been a while since my last serious post. Maybe I should blame Twitter and other micro-blogging services who allowed me to blog only in 140 characters and that don't require you to sit down to write a whole post. But this one is different. It's a review of this first semester at EPFL. For those who don't know it, there are two Swiss Institutes of Technology. One in Lausanne (EPFL) and the other one in Zurich (ETHZ).

## General Overview

The campus itself is awesome. Unlike ETHZ or Oxford, EPFL has a real campus. It is not just a bunch of buildings inside a city. It's actually a few miles away from Lausanne (It takes about 15 minutes from the city center with the M1 metro). Most buildings are built with the same architectural style. Not that interesting. However some buildings stand out.

## Rolex Learning Center

This is one of the newest buildings on campus. It's really impressive. This building holds the library and is a convenient place to work. You can also eat there. You can choose between three different types of food. The first one is the "Table de Vallotton", it's the best restaurant on campus with a wonderful view. It's also the most expensive one. As an undergrad don't expect to eat over there. There's also "Le Hodler", this is the student's restaurant inside the Rolex. You can get there a lunch for 7 swiss franc with your students card (which is pretty cheap for what you get). At the same place you can also queue to get a Pizza or Burger/Meat. I would personally advise you the "Steak de Cheval" which is the best piece of meat you'll probably get on campus. The prices are subject to change so check out their website for daily meals and prices. If you just want a quick snack (sandwich, tea, coffee or croissant) you can go to the "Klee Cafeteria". Note that this cafeteria is open even on sundays and during the week it's open until 22 pm. (btw the Rolex Learning Center closes daily at midnight)

The library is big but unfortunately it's not always easy to find a place to work. UNIL (Université de Lausanne), HEC (Haute Ecole de Commerce) and other students discovered this beautiful building and since EPFL is a public school we can't kick them out which is so annoying.

As a student you can ask at the reception a workspace commonly called a "bubble". These are round workspaces where you can work in groups up to 12 people. It's a really convenient place to work in group. Each bubble has a code so you can't access those without reservation. Tip: you can reserve them by email.

Under the Rolex Learning Center is EPFL's biggest parking. If you are arriving after 8 am you won't have much chance to find a place.

## Quartier Nord

If you take the metro to arrive at EPFL you'll have noticed the building works. They started building what's going to be the Swiss Tech Convention center. It aims to bring more life to the campus with some extra bedrooms too. The architecture and technology of this place is incredible. 

## Computer Science

I like a lot of things. I took a while making up my mind about what I wanted to study. I was highly interested in Physics, Bio Engineering, Electronics and Computer Science. I chose the last one. Why ? I'm still not sure. Maybe just because I hate chemistry and all others required to take those classes.

The first year in Computer Science starts like in every other university. Digital Systems, Basics of Programming, Math (Linear Algebra and Calculus) and Information Theory (Cryptography, Data Compression and Error-correction codes).

From an educational point of view, most courses were good. I would like to point out one course given by [Jean-Yves Le Boudec](http://lcawww.epfl.ch/leboudec/) about Information Theory. Not only because the course contents are highly interesting but because they way the course is given is game-changing.  The course is highly participative. Definitely the best course of this first term.

The Computer Science department also has a noticeable building.

## Research

When I arrived at EPFL I completely under-estimated the amount of research that being done at EPFL. I think they are aiming at the right technologies. They are researching what the industry really needs. That's why they get so much funding. Over the few last years, EPFL climbed to the top of all the rankings in engineering. Currently 20th in the Shanghai ranking and even better in others. But I don't think the ascension is slowing down. EPFL has great ambitions. Some students say that EPFL is focusing too much on research and not enough on education. I think that both are tied together. If you improve research, you'll get better professors and better PhD which will also improve the quality of education.

Also, having better research means having more companies interested in having a research center on campus which means having more funding and jobs opportunities so this highly benefits to students as well.

## Lausanne

Lausanne is a great place to stay. You'll probably enjoy living and walking by the lake. The city center is a great place for shopping. The prices can be insanely expensive for foreigners due to the debt crisis in the Eurozone and US. Still you'll always find a place to eat for a decent price. Food on campus is the way to go if you want to have a good and cheap meal. Finding a place to stay is not an easy task. Lausanne is overcrowded (EPFL's success is also part of this). Well not Beijing overcrowded.
