In case you missed it, Facebook did just announce something called ["The Facebook Graph Search"](https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch).

It's looking really great from a user-perspective but I think the real genius is in its advertising potential.

![Search](http://f.cl.ly/items/451i383L321l3g1c2j2C/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-15%20at%2011.00.24%20PM.png)

As many of you nerds probably know, when you're trying to sell advertising online two things do really matter. 

**Context** is about knowing your user. You know what he likes, where he stays, where he goes and what his friends like. This is extremely valuable and Facebook has been doing a lot of money thanks to that. But the reason why Facebook ads transformation rate (people actually buying an advertised product) is very low. That can be explained by the current lack of the second factor.

**Intent** is what you're user is looking for. What he wants right now. Google's advertising business has been driven by intent. They know what their users are looking for but don't really know the users well enough to advertise the right product.

The real goldmine is having both[^1]. Hence, this new Search feature may be the missing part of Facebook's monetization theory. 

As always, I would love to hear your thoughts about this.
