Early December, I booked a flight back to Belgium to celebrate the holidays with my family. I knew I had a Brussels Airlines account but I couldn't remember my password.[^1] I went to the password recovery page and entered my email address. A few seconds later, I got a password recovery email but when I opened it I saw something terribly wrong. My password was appearing in bold plain text just there in front of me. 

![Plain Text Email](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1H1B010B2U1R1x2y3Q0j/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-29%20at%2011.07.31%20AM.png)

I immediately reached out to Twitter to let them know they really shouldn't store plain text passwords.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Itâ€™s intolerable that @<a href="https://twitter.com/flyingbrussels">flyingbrussels</a>stores the passwords of their clients in plain text !<a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23security">#security</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23fail">#fail</a></p>    <div><a href="https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs/status/276072720654028800">December 4, 2012</a></div></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

I only got an answer a few days later. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs">fredericjacobs</a> Hi Frederic, this is our official Twitter account. Is there anything we can still help you with?</p>    <div><a href="https://twitter.com/FlyingBrussels/status/278841769221832704">December 12, 2012</a></div></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

I then told them about the security issue they were having and they overall dealt very professionally about it.

They suggested me to remove my tweet.  

> To avoid that any other tweeps get the idea to hack into the profiles of mybrusselsairlines members, could I kindly ask you if it is possible to remove the tweets about plain text password storage. Although we are against any form of censorship, we just ask this to not encourage others to abuse this information. I will personally keep you updated about the measures we will take.


Asking customers to delete tweets is not something to do (even though you are claiming it's not an attempt of censorship). It will just draw more attention to the case. I wasn't pointing at any way to sneak into their system and get passwords. I was just blaming them for using plain text password storage.

The goal of this post is not to point at Brussels Airlines (or Emakina, the web agency who realized their website). It's more about understanding what mistakes were made and how to deal with it. 

# Why is storing passwords in plain text bad ?

Let's start with reminding that most people use the same password for all web services.[^2] Of course this is not a wise thing to do but you shouldn't blame your users if you have a way of keeping them safe.

There are [a lot of stories about people getting one password hacked and losing progressively control over all their favorite web services](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/).

There have been a few blog posts already about reasons [why it's bad to store passwords in plain text]. But here's my take on it.

## 1) Protecting the privacy of your users

Someone in the IT department at least needs to have access to the database in which the passwords are stored and it's unacceptable that all our passwords are standing there in plain text for him to read. 

As a company, you want to respect the privacy of your users. Storing passwords in plain text could result in abuse of your employees. You don't want to risk that an employee with bad intentions could hack into a customer's account and possibly connect to a passenger's Facebook or Email account.

I'm sure you want to limit that risk as much as possible.

## 2) No one is invulnerable

Let's face it, you're vulnerable. Everyone is. 

> To Err is Human.


Everybody hack in systems these days. Competing companies, governments or just internet activists like Anonymous or Lulzsec that are doing it just for the lulz or protecting ethical values.

The best way to prepare yourself to be exposed is to make sure you don't store information that would hurt the user if it's being released.

> Passwords are the most precious keys to our digital lives and your service has no reason to store them in plaintext. 


Once the information is out there for everyone to see, you'll wish you had protected those passwords.

## 3) Email is not always a secure channel

Emails are read on a lot of different devices these days and in a lot of places. Phones with email capability can be lost or stolen. I don't want the guy that finds my phone to find my password by searching my inbox for "password". 

But that's only one kind of theft of information. Other kind of theft of information can happen.

A lot of people are using unsecured wifi connections on their laptops or smartphones to access the internet. It's important to remind people that anyone on that network could sniff your traffic and intercept your unsecured traffic. 

Unfortunately, some email providers including Scarlet don't provide SSL encryption for POP/IMAP/SMTP access. Hence, you can easily sniff their user's email traffic on an unsecured internet connection and if the user happen to be resetting his password, the hacker could easily intercept that information.

# How to make it safer

> The minute we store a user's password, we've taken on the responsibility of securing their password


This part is going to be more technical. In short, there are ways to verify a user's identity and/or credentials without compromising on security and without storing passwords.

## Hashing is not good enough, don't forget the salt

The most obvious way of securing passwords would be to compute MD5 hashes of these passwords.

Although it's already a first step, it's far from being secure enough. MD5 is crackable, easily crackable. A ten digits password that gets the "strong" indicator on most websites can easily be cracked in less than 3 minutes using the [Rainbow Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table), pre-computer tables for reversing hashes. [Ophcrack](http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/) ships with GigaBytes of rainbow tables making the process incredibly quick and easy. [A study shows](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/rainbow-hash-cracking.html) that it's able to crack 99.9% of all possible 14 character alphanumeric passwords in less than 11 minutes from LM Hashes.

Rainbow tables are incredibly powerful, so what should I do ? 

Well, the answer is easy. [Salting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)). It's so easy.

As you just learned, Rainbow tables are **pre-computed** hashes. It's because MD5 is deterministic. It will only reverse the correspondence given by the rainbow table.

So instead of hashing "hello"

	hash("hello")                    = 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824

You'll be hashing ("hello"+ a random string)

	hash("hello" + "YYLmfY6IehjZMQ") = a49670c3c18b9e079b9cfaf51634f563dc8ae3070db2c4a8544305df1b60f007

You'll have to store both in your database to be able to compute the matching hash again. 

> More technically, salts protect against rainbow tables as they, in effect, extend the length and potentially the complexity of the password. If the rainbow tables do not have passwords matching the length (e.g. an 8-byte password, and 2-byte salt, is effectively a 10-byte password) and complexity (non-alphanumeric salt increases the complexity of strictly alphanumeric passwords) of the salted password, then the password will not be found. If found, one will have to remove the salt from the password before it can be used.

If you want to learn more about why reusing salts is a bad idea or learning more about them I would advise you to head over to [crackstation](http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm).

## Two-Factor Authentication

What is two-factor authentication ? Here is what Wikipedia says about it

> Two-factor authentication (TFA, T-FA or 2FA) is an approach to authentication which requires the presentation of two or more of the three authentication factors: a knowledge factor ("something the user knows"), a possession factor ("something the user has"), and an inherence factor ("something the user is").

Hence, sending an SMS-authentication code the first time a user connects from a new location is a good way to provide two-factor authentication. 

Services like Facebook and Dropbox already offer this functionality and I personally appreciate it very much.

The biggest challenge is finding a balance between user-experience and security. Facebook deals very well with it. My privacy settings are currently set to "light" two factor auth which means I'm only asked to review my login when I'm connecting from a new device or if my location changed radically since my last login.

# Making the big step 

Brussels Airlines did act professionally about it. They asked each user to reset his password after they changed to hashed passwords. It's a proof of great wisdom and I would definitely advise you to do the same in the transition.

![Reset Password](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3H2L2F2b3O380D411E2g/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-19%20at%208.24.16%20PM.png)

To conclude, it's a shame that so many companies are still storing passwords in plain text without realizing the consequences it can have on their customer's lives. With great power comes great responsibilities.


[^1]: 	I usually use [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) to derive my passwords but in this case I something went wrong.

[^2]: I'll probably write a follow-up post soon to describe a few ways to keep safely track of your different passwords without affecting your experience while browsing the web.
