Rumors have been a long way since I tweeted I was moving to the Valley. I've been fully commited to movies.io lately and therefore people started thinking we were already moving over there. Believe me, there's no better place to launch movies.io than Switzerland and we're really not considering leaving (except to sign partnerships). 

So, what is it all about then ? Well, I'm off to work for *Storify* during the summer. As you know, Storify is the ultimate tool to provide social storytelling. I'll be spending July and August in San Francisco (ping me if you wanna meet up). I can tell you there are a bunch of cool new products in the pipelines. This summer will be hot. I'm really looking forward working with this amazingly dynamic team. 

Stay tuned. 

PS : Does that mean movies.io's growth will be affected ? No. Being close to content-owners and investors can only help.
