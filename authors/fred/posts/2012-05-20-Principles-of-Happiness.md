> ### Spend time with the right people. 
The greatest happiness levels are associated with spending time with people we like. Socially connecting activities - such as hanging out with friends and family - are responsible for the happiest parts of the day. However, work is also an essential element in the time-happiness relationship. Although spending time with bosses and coworkers tends to be associated with some of the lowest degrees of happiness, two of the biggest predictors of people's general happiness are whether they have a 'best friend' at work and whether they like their boss. Therefore, people should try to reframe relationships and workplace goals such that colleagues become friends so that time spent at work becomes happier.

That's one of the main reasons I believe startups are that effective. People enjoy going to work because they enjoy being with their coworkers and making things happen. You don't work for your paycheck, you work to create and have fun. The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more with an amazing team.

> ### Spend time on the right activities. 
Certain activities are energizing, and others make us feel drained and defeated. To increase happiness, people should avoid spending time on the latter activities in favor of the former whenever possible. Of course, the bills have to be paid, the bathroom cleaned, and it's sometimes a challenge to get through the day. But people need to reflect on how they are spending their time - the extent to which they mindlessly move from activity to activity without considering what they would really prefer to be doing. For instance, when deciding how to spend the next hour, simply asking yourself the question, 'Will what I do right now become more valuable over time?' could increase the likelihood that you behave in ways that are more in line with what will really make you happy.

And this isn't about money or personal success. The feeling of working on things that you feel are right is priceless. Supporting a cause that is worth supporting will make you feel better. Don't waste your time mourning or blaming yourself but be the change you want to see. People often believe other people will fix their pains. Stop thinking than and start doing things because you are the one that can make all the difference.

> ### Enjoy experiences without spending time actually doing them. 
Research in the field of neuroscience has shown that the part of the brain responsible for feeling pleasure - the mesolimbic dopamine system - can be activated when merely thinking about something pleasurable, such as drinking a favorite brand of beer or driving a favorite type of sports car. In fact, this research shows that people sometimes enjoy anticipating an activity more than actually doing it.

>For example, reading guidebooks in advance of a big vacation and anticipating the food you'll eat and the activities you'll do while there could actually give you more pleasure than the vacation itself. In short, research suggests that we can be just as well - if not sometimes better - off if we imagine experiences without having them. So to increase happiness, spend plenty of time happily daydreaming.

When I was in middle-school teachers were complaining all the time about the fact that I was daydreaming all day. People often think that daydreaming is bad because it reduces the worker's productivity. This idea was maybe true at the time of the industrial revolution where everything needed to be mechanical and repetitive but when it comes to creativity and coming up with solutions to a real problem daydreaming is only the result of keeping problems longer in mind to come up with more creative ideas.

Using our front-lobe to project ourselves into a hypothetical future also helps us to keep faith in something that may be difficult to achieve and strength to persevere when going through difficult times.

> ### Expand your time. 
Unlike money, time is inherently scarce. No one gets more than 24 hours per day. In fact, there is a bidirectional relationship between time's scarcity and its value: not only does having little time make it feel more valuable, but when time is more valuable, it is perceived as more scarce. To increase happiness, it can make sense to focus on the here and now -because thinking about the present moment (vs. the future) has been found to slow down the perceived passage of time. Simply breathing more deeply can have similar effects. 

>In one study, subjects who were instructed to take long and slow breaths (vs. short and quick ones) for five minutes not only felt there was more time available to get things done, but also perceived their day as longer. And even though feeling time-constrained makes people less likely to take the time to help someone else, doing so actually makes people feel as though they have more spare time and gives them a sense of a more expansive future. Therefore, if you can't afford to "buy" more discretionary time, focus on the present moment, breathe more slowly, and spend the little time that you have in helpful and meaningful ways.

Time is an incredibly scarce ressource. I have full-time studies, a full-time job and I'm trying to keep a social life on top of that. So what is going away ? Sleep probably. But what I got instead of sleep, whether it is an interesting discussion or  a coding night have outcomes that are having just so much impact that the lack of sleep doesn't appear to matter that much. 

*Advise to freshmans :* At the beginning of the semester, try judging what courses are really worth attending and which ones are just wasting your time. If you can spend quarter the time of the lecture to study the course by reading a book, do that. You will recover a lot of time that would have been wasted and that you'll have the chance to spend on your own projects. 

> ### Be aware that happiness changes over time. 
As we age, we experience different levels of happiness and how we experience happiness changes. Recent research found that younger people are more likely to experience happiness as excitement, whereas older individuals are more likely to experience happiness as feeling peaceful. Therefore, you should be aware that basing future decisions on your current perceptions of happiness may not lead to the maximum levels of happiness in the long run.

>Finally, although the meaning of happiness may change, it does so in predictable patterns. Therefore, it is possible to anticipate such changes, and you should allow yourself to shift how you spend your time over the course of your life - as the meaning of happiness shifts.

You are young, be bold. Experiment in all possible ways. Not much else to say.

### Conclusion
In addition to PG's saying :

- Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy. 

You should add :

- Spend your time doing the things you love with people you love.
