Yesterday I emailed a family's friend because he got chosen to be the CEO of public transportation company. My emailed contained two parts. The part where I congratulated him and a part where I outlined three issues that I would put on my priority list of things to change as quickly as possible. 

He emailed back to me today claiming that my last email was disrespectful. That I didn't have enough experience to make such claims and blah blah blah. 

This shows how huge the cultural gap is between tech companies and other industries. I regularly point out things I want to see to change in tech companies and CEOs usually really welcome that. Especially when they are on boarding a new company. But here I got blamed for trying to give advise. 

This is basically what I've been told to do my whole childhood. In Europe you're told to shut up if you are not qualified in a specific field. *Old Europe, you're doing it wrong.*

## Why innovation fails in Europe	

> For the purpose of the argument I'm gonna take my personal experience as the "regular" european study case. As you probably know there are places like Northern European countries where they are evolving in educational techniques but I think my case is valid for people attending traditional (often catholic) european schools. 

### Education

The problem starts with education. If you compare US education with the european model, you'll quickly notice that american kids are getting more *confident* of what they are doing very early in life. European kids are still being punished with public humiliation (yes, kids have to stand in corner of rooms when the teacher believes they did something bad). Because of that european kids lose a lot of confidence.

Very early in life, I had the chance to attend international summer camps. I was always impressed by how brits and americans were standing out the crowd because of their confidence (and no it was not only because they knew the language better). They did express their opinion way more accurately and more often than all the other kids combined. 

The simple fact of being open-minded to hear people's opinion are bringing you in a completely different mindset. You lean how other people are experiencing things and give you another vision of the world.

But it isn't only about opinions, it's also about *questions*. 

> Smart people ask questions

While going through high school I wasn't really confident asking questions because people judge you on the questions you ask. That retention actually makes you completely dumb. When I moved to the Valley, I noticed people weren't afraid of asking even simplistic questions and it was my great pleasure to answer them. And that is as it should be.* People shouldn't be afraid of asking questions.* There shouldn't be any kind of peer pressure in class where kids are not feeling confident to ask questions and end up not succeeding the class.

Everything I described on top of this is not only true at school. It pursues you your whole life and definitely affect both enterprise and entrepreneurs.

### Why religion doesn't help

I respect people having different religious beliefs. But no matter what your beliefs are there are a few things that are definitely wrong with the way we think of religions. 

I've been raised in a fairly catholic family. But it actually doesn't really matter because the whole society is affected by this historical religious belief in Europe. 

What worries me is that religion claims that there is a book of undeniable truths. This is a very dangerous statement because people actually stop questioning themselves about those issues. They just take them as granted which brings me to the next point.

### Vision of life 

> When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.

> That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

These words come out of an interview of Steve Jobs. It's one of the things that changed me forever when I read it. It actually empower people to stop blaming themselves about how miserable they are and that give them the faith they can change it. Of course, not everyone can come up with the next iPhone. But it tells people what's important.

> Just do it. 

So these are some thoughts that came to my mind this morning after having read this upsetting email response. If your a leader, proof it with thoughts not authority.

Oh right ! I'm not supposed to talk, I'm ignorant.

**Update** : I'm not gonna release the emails for the moment since I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm not gonna use those European public exposure shame techniques to make my point.  I showed them to my sister and she pointed out that some of my wording could have been understood the wrong way. I made a suggestion that may have sounded like an implicit order (which it obviously wasn't).  I still believe it wasn't a reason to get an email back with such an offensive wording.
