Over the past few months I've been thinking a lot about dropping-out to move to Silicon Valley full-time. I found out that moving to the Valley wasn't the answer to my problem. Instead of just complaining about lack of innovation and its underlying reasons in Switzerland I just gathered everything I knew about entrepreneurship, hacking and having fun to merge them into a single organization, HackEPFL.

## Arriving to EPFL

I'm not Swiss. I moved from Belgium to Switzerland after I graduated from high school. I had considered applying in the US but my parents didn't want me to leave Europe. So I had the choice to apply anywhere in Europe. I considered Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College, Berlin, Ghent and a few others. They all seemed very interesting. 

But EPFL (aka Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) seemed incredibly promising. It seemed like the startup of Universities. A smaller structure that makes progressively it's way to the top of the rankings. It looked very attractive to people like me passionate about entrepreneurship and hacking. 

A lot of people confirmed this, I was talking to a friend who studied at ETHZ (The German speaking Swiss Institute of Technology)

> EPFL and ETHZ are like two school children. But if ETHZ is the top of the class kid, EPFL is more the Rock & Roll kid. 

That being said, my choice was immediate. It's a really inspiring environment. The mountains, the lake, the buildings and the climate are all part of this very enjoyable environment. Low-tuition fees (around 600$ / semester for foreigners) makes it incredibly attractive even for overseas students.

As a freshman, I used to think that the main reason I was going to University was to learn stuff. But truth is, Universities are not the best place to learn things anymore. This may have been true 10 years ago but now with the rise of online education the chances that your teacher is way more boring than the one on Coursera teaching the same course are high. Education is broken and it needs to be fixed. 

If you have the motivation to learn stuff, university is no more required. Knowledge is out there. What makes higher education institutions it still attractive for most people in this case? 

People want a *diploma*. Yeah you're right. Most of them are going through college to get a piece of paper that guarantees them to have a job (at least it's the case in Switzerland, I know it's no more the case in Spain, Italy or Greece). 

But let's face it. Diplomas are not a very good indicator of some people's technical abilities. For having worked in the tech industry, I can tell that startups don't care about your piece of paper. Instead they do care about your experience and your code. Your GitHub profile says way much more about you than your diploma does. A diploma attests you have gotten to memorize a certain amount of things but says very little of what you did with it.

The tech industry is very special and probably this is not applicable to other industries.

## What are making universities special ? 

The real value in Universities are the people that compose them. It will be the only place where you'll meet people not having to worry too much about fixed incomes and people willing to take high risks. Moreover, you'll have the chance to meet people sharing your interests if you study something you really care about. This opportunity is unique, don't waste it.

## Where is the magic happening ? 

Already as a teenager I've been influenced by the dynamism of Silicon Valley. When I moved to EPFL in the first place I felt like I was looking for a lost paradise.

EPFL wasn't as dynamic as I thought it would be. Let's face it, EPFL is not Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech or Carnegie Mellon. 

> People don't do crazy things or don't spend time on side projects.

## What's wrong with the other organizations 

We do have organizations on the campus but none of them has a focus on building technology or real value. PolyProg focuses on the algorithmic programming. We really like what they are doing. They are different because they focus on the algorithmic aspect of programming while HackEPFL puts the application of technology first. You may have worked on a brilliant algorithms for months but if it's application doesn't solve a problem it will be less relevant to HackEPFL.

On the other side of the scope there are things like startup weekend. Startup Weekend isn't a hackathon. They don't value ideas that are build. They value potential businesses.

> Done is better than perfect

HackEPFL will really value people building things no matter if it can transform in a viable business or not.

## Dropping out

By the end of my first year of college, I was almost dropping out. I was about to sign a contract with a well-known Silicon Valley startup and was about to move over to the Valley to work full-time. But after a week of questioning myself and with the insistence of my parents not to drop out. I decided to give college a second chance.

Silicon Valley is suffering from a lack of engineers and the Visa crisis is not helping affecting the growth of a lot of companies and startups. Huge companies like Facebook, Google and Apple are hiring aggressively amongst startup people and when you're not sure about the future of your startup you may just want to gain stability by joining those companies.

Of course being in the Valley has it's advantages and has also a lot of disadvantages.

But I strongly believe that the EPFL region has high potential for startups. The environment is right. Living with the Leman lake and not far from the mountains is quite similar in some sense to living in the bay area.
 
Yesterday, I went to #TEDxBrussels where Steve Wozniak did his talk about Technology and The Social Revolution. 

Steve's presentation was breath-taking. Steve's vision is really focused on an expandable device. He's a hacker and loves to build extensions to limited devices. He designed the Apple II to be extendible and regrets the way Apple has evolved into a company that's building a lot on top of proprietary technology.

He brought us back in time detailing how hacking at the **Homebrew Computer Club** led to Apple Computers. 

> The Homebrew Computer Club was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically-minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of computing devices.

Aren't these the core values we want for HackEPFL ? We want enthusiasts, whether they have a technical background or not. We want HackEPFL to be an organization that pushes forward the sharing of ideas. We don't care whether you're from EPFL or not, if you study computer science or don't, if you like Macs or PCsâ€¦  The only thing that matters is to build technology. 

> "The role of technology is to create devices to make life better" - Steve Wozniak

In the evening, I went to dinner with the speakers (Thanks [Xavier](http://www.twitter.com/xdamman) for the introduction). I had the chance to chat for a while with Wozniak and had the chance to lay out my plans for HackEPFL. He really profoundly endorsed HackEPFL.

When asked what he would tell young innovators, he told me

> The main thing is to have a reason for what you're doing and believe that you can find a formula to solve a problem. Your first innovations should have strong personal value but no value to the world necessarily. The should be little things that can develop your skills.
> Don't believe in other people when they say that it's not how the world works. Keep it to your heart. Don't think your first innovations will be highly successful, if you start building them for yourself that's better. Don't think you can write down a business plan, raise some money and then hire the engineers to do it. The engineers have to be part of the defining process. You should have a working model before you work on the money part. These are some of the ideas I want to give to young people.

**HackEPFL** is named that way because it refers to geographical location where we are based but has no particular affiliations to the institution itself. 

What I want **HackEPFL** to be is the organization that nurtures creativity. We want you to solve problems, not build companies. If you solve a problem that a lot of people are having in an elegant way, you might turn your hack into a company. Innovation works that way. You don't start with a company and build the product after.
