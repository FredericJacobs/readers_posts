You might say, I'm not going to read *another* blog post about this Facebook-Instagram deal. It has been widely covered but most of the time with a biaised perspective.

Instagram was a cheap deal for Facebook. Focusing on the dollar amount is frankly meaningless unless you were an investor or employee in Instagram. The only really important number is that the deal represents 1% of Facebook. The $1 billion number arises based on the assumption that Facebook will IPO at about a $100 billion valuation.

1% of Facebook is so little to the founders and shareholders of Facebook that the deal was concluded over the weekend without any approval of the board.

> Zuckerberg, who said to have been *negotiating mostly on his own*, reportedly told the board of his intention to buy the popular photo sharing app on April 8, three days after opening negotiations with its founder Kevin Systrom. Systrom is said to have been seeking $2 billion for the company.

> Mr. Zuckerberg owns 28% of Facebook's stock, and **controls 57%** of its voting rights, giving him the freedom to act independently if he wants. Mr. Systrom, similarly, owns about 45% of his company. That control means investors must accept the fact that the CEOs can move quickly.

Last Tuesday during the entrepreneurship class, the teacher claimed that Facebook did buy Instagram for the users primarily. Well I think this statement is incorrect.

Of course, the user base helps but I don't think it was the main reason in the decision process.

Keep in mind that the IT-industry is like non-other. You don't evaluate companies like in any other industry. Instagram is not making any money and their product is so simple to reproduce that if they start ruining the experience with ads, a new Instagram will come up.

But how much would Facebook value Instagram and it's users ?

> - 45 million dollars for every month worked on Instagram

> - 76 million dollars per employee (just 13 of them according to Wikipedia)

> - about 30 dollars for every user

> - about a dollar for every photo

A lot of Facebook users are Instagram users and most of those who aren't are probably not the kind of people that will be Facebook users (Phil Schiller for instance). These people used to go on Instagram before it became mainstream and would probably have stopped when it became just another social network. 

# So users aren't that much of a big deal for Facebook. But guess what is ? **Talents**

Yes. Facebook is known for [big talent acquisitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Facebook). Facebook is a company that has one of the best engineering cultures in the industry. They are clearly an excellent place to work for brilliant engineers. But for some reasons Facebook always sucked at design. All talented designers at Facebook joined after startup's acquisitions. Made by Sofa, Gowalla &; Beluga are only a few examples of this. 

Except, Instagram is different. Zuckerberg has posted an article to announce the Instagram acquisition in which he clearly points out the Instagram Experience and that they are commited to continue building and growing Instagram  independently. 

Facebook is a huge company and most analysts will probably say "well, if they need an advise about User Experience they can just hire any consultant. They don't need to acquire Instagram to do it". But instead Facebook admits it will try to learn from Instagram's experience to build similar features into their products. Keep in mind that maximum 5 people were in charge of product developement at Instagram. Facebook must want them very badly.

Acquiring talents is only part of the plan. The Facebook platform has many products (Messages, Pictures, Events â€¦). Each one is build by a different team. Zuck acquired Beluga to build a better Facebook Messenger on Mobile. I believe buying Instagram is their way to get the best picture sharing experience on mobile. I miss the days where the Facebook app was a native app developed by Joe Hewitt.

In the future, I believe Facebook will keep it's main app for browsing the Facebook Platform but will have more apps linked to products (like they already did with the Messages). You'll end up with a folder on your iPhone having all Facebook apps and personnaly if this is their way to make a comeback with native app developement I like it. 

A final point I would like to make is that Facebook is very likely to build it's own phone. They are a platform and they have a portfolio of apps that is more threatening Google than Apple. The Facebook phone is in the works for sure and the Instagram team will probably have to focus on getting Instagram for that phone.

To end with a quote by Zuck 

> Our goal is not to build a platform; it's to be cross all of them.
