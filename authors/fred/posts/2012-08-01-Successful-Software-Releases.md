I'm sometimes asked what makes software releases successful. Here are a few things I've learned from previous releases.  These are the kind of things you don't learn in college.

This post is targeted for an audience getting started with their first release. If you're experienced you may just want to skip this post.

> Code Wins Arguments

When you start working on a product with a team a lot of features are discussed and it's often not that clear how some stuff should be implemented. Instead of discussing for hours and hours about which is best, I like to build early stage prototypes of both solutions. Once you tried both solutions you'll probably know with what solution you're gonna stick.
 
## Build, don't plan

When you start a project. Don't try to plan everything from the start like most MBA's would tell you to do. It probably won't work and making estimates on software development time is very hard. So try building right away, don't waste your time on a planning that you'll have a bad time respecting. 

I'm encouraging to list the feature that you want in your initial release. It should in my opinion be your minimal viable product (aka MVP).

## Get Advice

Try finding people who belong to the category of people who are the most likely to use your website/app and notice their reaction as they discover it. It's very important to do this at an early stage. A lot of companies are doing this way too far down the road and changing things at that point is way harder. 

If you're working on an iPhone App code signing may look at first sight like an issue for user testing. Thankfully, [Testflight](http://www.testflight.com) enabled you to easily distribute your iOS applications to a wide range (100 max limitation from Apple) of users.

Getting feedback from other developers using the same stack as you do is a precious asset. They will allow you to point the finger at security flaws or bugs you may not have thought of.

Launching as a private beta is not only smart from a product testing point of view but will also make you good press. People love being part of something exclusive. They also tend to show it to their friends who don't have access. Those will probably remember it if it was cool and be amongst your first users when the site goes live. 

If your platform has a social aspects, having engaged beta-testers is a seed in your database. When your website/app will go live, the users will be happy to see that their geeky friends are already using it which is a good incentive for them to join too. 

Another advantage of launching as a beta first is that people are going to be way more tolerant towards bugs as long as it's in beta.

Some people I met were afraid of launching at an early stage thinking that people will copy their concept. Keep this in mind. It's not that much about the idea itself. It's about how you bring it to life. Instagram is a brilliant example of this. Building a photo-sharing app is in the reach of anyone but how they build it really made a change. Details do matter.

## Releasing

> Programmers don't burn out on hard work, they burn out on change-with-the-wind directives and not 'shipping'.

After a lot of work, here comes the release. At this stage you need your MVP to be completely stable and polished after user testing.

You'll show it to the world and you don't want them to think your service is unreliable because most users won't come back after a first bad experience. 

The release is a moment where you'll probably get the biggest growth ever so be ready for it.. Make sure you can scale your site quickly. If you can't, make sure you have some buffering system for sign ups so that signed up users don't experience any slowing down on your website.

Another important aspect is to make sure that you engage your users from the start. You obviously want them to easily subscribe for updates about your creation.

Depending on the service you're providing, make sure that you're targeting your promotion to the right people. There's probably an online community sharing similar interest that will be your online evangelists and will get you your first press coverage.
You don't especially need to start with the biggest ones.

## Keep your ears and eyes open

People will be blogging about your service (or won't). Make sure you catch them with Google Alerts or any analytics solution that provides the ability to see a detailed view of the referrals.
Search social media to hear what people are saying about your service. Don't be afraid to reach them personally (they actually love that). Every feedback is valuable. 

If something goes wrong, don't lie. Try it's completely fine to mess up when you get started, you don't need to hide it.
