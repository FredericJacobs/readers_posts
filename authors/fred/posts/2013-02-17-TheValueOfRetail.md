It's been now more than a year and a half that I moved to Switzerland. 

For more than I year, I didn't go skiing once although I was so close of the Alps. I suddenly decided that it had to change.

So I went on a mission : Buying skis.

I've been skiing since I'm very young. I remember going to the mountains with my parents at a very early age but until now, I've had always rented skis.

Having never bought skis before, I looked up on the Internet a place that could provide me the best advise possible. I wanted to explain what I needed to someone with expertise on the topic and he would advise me in an unbiassed way what would be the best skis for me.

I didn't care paying a few more hundred bucks. I value his expertise and that's exactly the remaining value of retail in the digital age.

Internet is probably always cheaper than real life shops and I really like shopping on the Internet when I know precisely what I want. When it comes to buying tech stuff, my expertise in the matter allows me to make a rational decision based on the specs I'm reading online but anyone unfamiliar with computers doesn't have a clue about the signification of those specs and do value an external advise from a shop holder.

I often hear people being worried about the Internet businesses putting retail stores out of business.

The only way to survive as a retailer in the digital age is to provide additional services that online transactions can't provide.

Huge stores like the MediaMarkt, BestBuy, FreeRecordShop, FNAC might face difficult times if they don't adapt to provide a better, more tailored advise to their customers.

Apple understood that. You are not walking in an Apple Store to walk through shelves of merchandise you can choose from on your own without having anyone to advise you. On the contrary, the stores are organized around two things : demos and assistance.

I feel way more confident to buy clothes or a computer I could try before. And that's something the internet can't provide.

In addition to that, assistance is a crucial concept. For people feeling uneasy with computers, having a "genius" that walks you through the set up process is a very comfortable and reassuring experience.

People who know what they want will order it online because it's cheaper but there's always a big market for people who want a personal tailored advise. And that market is not likely to disappear even if online shopping gets smarter.

You can continue to blame Internet businesses for killing your business or on the other hand you can craft a better retail experience for people needing advise and assistance.
