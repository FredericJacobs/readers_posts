We've been such a long way in such a little time. Just imagine where we can get with a bit more timeâ€¦

One Million page views on [movies.io](http://movies.io). In a bit more than a week. We gotta be touching something right, but what?

The movie industry is in a funny shape. I didn't say bad shape. The Avengers made some extraordinary incomes and profit is flowing. They want you to feel bad for downloading movies although they are still making a huge amount of profit. [Just do the math](http://www.youtube.com/embed/GZadCj8O1-0).

### Aiming the right people

Interestingly, content owners are not the ones we are trying to take down. We are not coming up with new content that is gonna replace their blockbusters and people will still be watching their content. Movie theater incomes are in most cases enough to cover the production costs. Their business remains viable even if people continue downloading their movies. Camrips are lame and if you want to watch a movie, just go out with friends and watch is on a big theater screen in 3D. The real experience. So there will always be a business for people willing to see the movie with the full experience that is going with it. Camrips are not killing the movie industry. No one is taking them seriously.

So, we found out that the big content owners/producers are not losing that much money in the digital age from downloading. They are not an issue. Their business could still work. So why is it for me so hard to watch that content ? Why is it for me such a pain to get these movies ? Hint : It's all about distribution.  

The first mistake they made was to believe they could charge the same for a physical version and a digital version. Indeed. Digital information is so cheap to clone that you can't justify charging the same for each copy as you used to. Steve Jobs cracked the problem in the Music industry but music labels never followed. He always said 

> Price aggressively and go for volume

Isn't the main goal of content producers  is to be seen ? Well. If you would charge less for a movie I would be glad to pay for it. But prices for buying movies online are just abusively high.

Second mistake, choosing a business model, not an experience. Back when I used to live in Belgium, we had at home a triple play offer covering the phone, internet and television. Each ISP has these kinds of offers featuring what they dare to call digital television. Each ISP has its own catalogue of movies which is part of its VOD (video-on-demand) offer. Each ISP negotiates different contracts with content owners and sign exclusive deals. So people are unable to have access to some content because of their service provider. This system is broken. All this is explained more clearly in the [don't make me steal manifesto](http://www.dontmakemesteal.com/en/).

Third mistake, decoders. Here's probably what sounded attractive to content-owners. They gave their content to ISPs and in exchange ISPs would protect it using their proprietary hardware so that it can only stay on your TV, that way no one would ever have a file of the movie. Sorry but this model is broken. If I buy a DVD I have the right to do what I want with it. I should be able to gift it to a friend, watch it at a friend's place, lend it to my grandmother ... I shouldn't be restricted by proprietary hardware. Oh did I also mention that this hardware really sucks at being intuitive ? Because it is a real disaster.


## Features

Movies.io has gotten a bunch of extra features since its launch. I can only encourage you to check it out. I'll try to regularly cover the addition of new features and to keep you posted of what's in the works.

- Since yesterday, trailers are now part of the movies.io experience. You now can watch the trailers directly from the film page in an elegant and convenient way.

- Watchlists have been redesigned and it's now easier than ever to add movies to several watchlists.

- If there is a feature that I really enjoy, it's the feed feature. You may not have noticed it because there is no such thing anywhere else. Let's say we want to organize a movie night at Jack's place. Jack adds all his friends to a watchlist and adds a feed to his torrent software. His friends, can decide what movie they would like to see and add it to the watchlist. When Jack gets home after having bought pizza and energy drinks for his homies,  all the movies are already downloaded and ready to watch. The torrent software took care of adding the all the downloads to the queue. Isn't that beautiful ? 

- Subtitles search has also been added recently. It's pretty cool and efficient. 

I'm happy to announce that localization is in the works and will be deployed soon following the huge demand.

## Credits

I want to start by thanking by dear co-founder, [Amos Wenger](http://amos.me/blog/2012/moviesio/), he originally came up with Movies and gets all credit for that. I would never jump in such an adventure without someone like him, being bold enough to believe, like me, that we can make a difference in movie distribution. I would also would like to thank everyone else that joined the rocket ship.
