I remember being told as a kid that patents where what was enabling and protecting innovation. Without them, no company could innovate because the financial incentives were not big enough.

It may be true for certain industries. I remember talking to [Severin Schwan](http://www.roche.com/executive_committee_severin-schwan.htm), CEO of Roche, about the patents in the pharmaceutical industry. He told me that researching drugs costs millions and takes often 5-10 years of intensive research before reaching the market. In such a setup I can understand that you need fixed incomes from your previous products to financially sustain the research of the next ones.  I don't think that patents are ethically correct but they sure used to be an efficient way of funding research.[^1]

[Ibuprofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen) has been around since the 1960's and is still used right now as a reference drug to relief fever. What about your software ? We do have some fundamental concepts that have been around for a while now. Graphical windows, drop-down menus and mouse interactions have been there for a while now and are implemented on every platform but for how long will they exist ? Tablet have radically changed those major interactions and are progressively taking more and more marketshare. 

Concepts come and go and the industry needs to adapt. I don't believe patents in the software industry are protecting innovations and innovators. 

Can you patent the mouse ? Can you patent a tap gesture ? 

Lawyers will argue that they can. But is this really the way we want technology to go ? I don't think so.

Building software doesn't cost millions. You can have a great idea in the heat of the moment and it can be implemented overnight. Pull-to-refresh is an example of that. It was invented by [Loren Brichter](https://twitter.com/lorenb) while he was building Tweetie, a Twitter client. It's now in every single application that I can think of on my iPhone. Even Apple implemented UIRefreshControl that's hugely inspired by Pull-to-Refresh. It's a great interaction and everyone benefits from using it. 

Now imagine if there was a patent on it[^2]. Since Apple considers patent infringement as a valid reason to reject an application on the App Store, it is very likely that the pull-to-refresh would only be available in the Tweetie app and it would be frustrating for the users and developers to be unable to have this great interaction in every app they use.

In such a system, developers could arguably probably make a lot of money by selling patents to the big guys. I can easily imagine a Google vs Apple competition where the war between iOS and Android was only about patent acquisitions.

That's not what I want. I want the best of all worlds and I believe it's what customers and developers want too. The developer community has always been known for being extremely open-minded. We have values and want our software to be the best it can be. If we believe that pull-to-refresh is a great solution, then we can implement that and even open-source it. 

The community has always been giving back what developers did for the it. Loren is a very respected developer and Tweetie definitely kicked off his career as an independent software developer and is now one of the most renown iOS developers.

The development cycle for software is evolving incredibly fast. You don't need millions to make innovations. Hackerspaces gather incredibly talented people with brilliant ideas. Engineers take control over their destiny and start building amazing stuff.

This transition where engineers are in control of an industry is frightening business people. Never before, a large scale industry was driven by the people who made the products. There was always this superficial layer on top of it, commonly called "The Managers". These were taking care that the business was still running. Since they didn't understand how the product was working, they made sure they got the money flowing in for the company on top of what they had and not what they were able to build. Patents where a safe way of preventing competition. But engineers, they are not afraid of competition and often even embrace it. 

I've been building clones and have been cloned. Let's take an example. Amos and myself released [movies.io](http://www.movies.io) that he initially built as a collaborative watchlist tool for himself and his girlfriend. We got trending on HackerNews for more than 24 hours and then the classic follow-up posts came along on a lot of popular websites like TorrentFreak and LifeHacker.

It didn't take a week before the first clones were showing up. We were so excited to see that our site had been cloned because it meant that people mattered. They loved the website and wanted to help to make it better. In most cases, if we had any ambitions of turning it into a business, I would have hired them because they were incredibly passionate and they loved what we were doing. In addition to that, their clones were different. We were able to identify what features they had and that would be valuable to our users. If we believed it was something we wanted, we would take the idea and implement it back into our website.

The key point here is summarized with this quote by Steve Jobs

> Good artists copy, great artists steal

Stealing an idea means making it your own. It means that you're taking an idea to make it better. Facebook is an instance of that. 

"Harvard Connection" was an idea that Mark stole to make "The Facebook". He didn't copy it, he stole the idea. Mark made it his own idea. He didn't simply implement what the Winklevoss brothers wanted. He made his own version on top of the stolen concept. And that's valuable. People having their own ideas (whether or not he stole the initial concept). In many ways, the Facebook vision was way broader than what the Winklevoss brothers had in mind. I don't think Zuck did anything wrong there. By attributing himself the idea, he was able to turn it into Facebook which probably would never have been the case of "Harvard Connection".

Like in every creative process, the artist should be first line. When you are part of a creative process, you need room to nurture your ideas and in many ways hierarchical management is killing that. I don't say that business people shouldn't be involved in the decision process, I just want the engineering culture in tech companies to prevail because they know what it takes to make it happen and should keep control over what they make.

Don't let lawyers take over the software industry. Software patents is their attempt to hijack it and put them in a powerful position, don't let it happen. 

[^1]: I said "used to be" because I'm a believer that with today's technology we can find alternative ways to fund research. [Crowdfunding](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/crowdfunding-innovation-sustainability-startups), [hackerspaces](http://biocurious.org/), OpenPCR â€¦ are all part of this new research ecosystem. You don't need to have a PhD to make significant progress for cancer research. Big shout out to [Shree Bose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIZfeYoPZzs) a friend of mine that helped moving forward in curing ovarian cancer when she was only 15. 

[^2]: [There actually is a Twitter patent on it](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/27/pull-to-refresh-the-patent/) but Brichter asked them not to enforce it.
